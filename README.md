# Condition Based Monitoring

1. The T-72 is a Soviet-designed main battle tank that has been widely used by various military
forces around the world. Introduced in the early 1970s, the T-72 was designed to be a
versatile, heavily armored, and cost-effective tank. It has seen extensive service in numerous
conflicts and has been continuously upgraded to meet modern battlefield requirements.

2. Due to multiple advanced technological systems installed in it, the Tanks are prone to
technical failure and predicting their engine life becomes a tedious task. The aim of this
project is to implemented a comprehensive Al-based classification system for T-72 tanks,
accurately predicting maintenance needs and extending operational life by 15%, thereby
ensuring optimal military readiness

The classification model is deployed on a web server of streamlit, where after proper filling of columnâ€™s datapoints, 
the app will predict in which band the Tank comes & whether it needs immediate servicing or not.
